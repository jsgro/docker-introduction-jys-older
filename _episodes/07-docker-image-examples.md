title: "Examples of Using Container Images in Practice"
teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I use Docker for my own work?"
objectives:
- "Use existing container images and Docker in a research project."
keypoints:
- "There are many ways you might use Docker and existing container images in your research project."

Now that we have learned the basics of working with Docker images and containers,
let's apply what we learned to an example workflow.

You may choose one or more of the following examples to practice using containers.

## Jekyll Website Example

In this [Jekyll Website example](../e02-jekyll-lesson-example), you can practice
rendering this lesson website on your computer using the Jekyll static website generator in a Docker container.
Rendering the website in a container avoids a complicated software installation; instead of installing Jekyll and all the other tools needed to create the final website, all the work can be done in the container.
Additionally, when you no longer need to render the website, you can easily and cleanly remove the software from your computer.

## GitHub Actions Example

In this [GitHub Actions example](../e01-github-actions), you can learn more about
continuous integration in the cloud and how you can use container images with GitHub to
automate repetitive tasks like testing code or deploying websites.

## Using Containers on an HPC Cluster

It is possible to run containers on shared computing systems run by a university or national
computing center. As a researcher, you can build and test your container on your own
computer and then use it to run your full-scale computing work on a shared computing
system like a high performance cluster or high throughput grid.

The catch? Most university and national computing centers do not support *running*
containers with Docker commands, and instead use a similar tool called Singularity or
Shifter. However, both of these programs can be used to run Docker container images,
so often people create their container as a Docker container image, so they can
run it using either of Docker or Singularity.

There isn't yet a working example of how to use Docker container images on a shared
computing system, partially because each system is slightly different, but the
following resources show what it can look like:

- [Introduction to Singularity](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/singularity-introduction/): See the episode titled "Running MPI parallel jobs using Singularity containers"
- [Container Workflows at Pawsey](https://pawseysc.github.io/container-workflows/): See the episode titled "Run containers on HPC with Shifter (and Singularity)"

## Sequence Alignment Examples

In these [sequence alignment examples](../e03-sequence-alignment) we explore **global, pair-wise** alignments as well as **multiple** sequence alignments of small peptide sequences, and sequences of the SARS-Cov2 Spike protein. For this we'll use 2 different images, one for the EMBOSS suite for pair-wise aligments, and one for ClustalOmega for multiple alignments. While we will use peptides and proteins, this would also apply to nucleotide sequences as well.

These examples will also help us learn more about Docker methods:   
* how to use the software from within or from outside the container.
* how to recognize, use, or by-pass an `ENTRYPOINT` command.

## Seeking Examples
